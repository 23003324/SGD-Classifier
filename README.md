# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.Load Data: Load the Iris dataset using load_iris() and create a pandas DataFrame with the feature names and target variable.

2.Prepare Features and Target: Split the DataFrame into features (X) and target (y) by dropping the target column from X.

3.Split Data: Use train_test_split to divide the dataset into training and testing sets with a test size of 20%.

4.Train Model: Initialize and fit a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier on the training data.

5.Evaluate Model: Predict the target values for the test set, calculate accuracy, and print the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
